    <h3>What I do</h3>
    <p>
      I specialize in full service web development for small- and medium-sized businesses in the Vancouver area.
    </p>

    <h3>That's nice, but what does it actually mean?</h3>

    <p>
      It means I don't just e-mail you some files and say "Here's that website you ordered. Good luck!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I assist your business every step of the way. From determining what you need, to making it happen, and providing ongoing support: All with minimal interruption to your operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find out more about what I can do for your business, please see my <a href="/clients">Clients page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also open to remote or local work in the Vancouver, BC area with the right organization. Please see my <a href="/employers">Employers</a> page or <a id="email" title="contact me" href="#">contact me</a>.
