I am available for hire for the right contract or full-time position. 

I'd love to join a team to join where I can further develop my skills.

While I would prefer to work locally in Vancouver, I am also open to remote positions.

## About me

I am a front-end web developer located in Vancouver, BC.

I completed the professional front-end development program at <a href="https://redacademy.com" target="_blank">RED Academy</a>.

I love to learn, and have a keen interest in all aspects of web development and operations. I am a long-time Linux user, and <span title="Including this one! NGINX + Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 16.04">administer several servers.</span>

## Skills

As a front-end web developer, I am proficient with the latest features of javascript, CSS3 and HTML5. My preferred javascript framework is currently Vue JS, but I'm generally framework-agnostic.

I am extremely adept at troubleshooting and getting to the root of a problem. I have strong need to understand how all the pieces fit together.

I love making fast, intuitive sites and applications. I am comfortable working from proofs, vague ideas, or anything between.
