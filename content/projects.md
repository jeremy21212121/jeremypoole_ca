Starling Minds is a mental health startup in Vancouver. They needed a content authoring application for making mixed-media courses. This was an internal, business-critical application that needed to integrate with an existing API in a very short timeline.

The application is built using Vue.js and Vuetify. I quickly integrated with their in-house design and back-end teams. Due to strict timelines, new features sometime had to be ready in hours or days.

Once it reached MVP status, I deployed the application multiple times per day to allow the content authoring team to get started. When large datasets started impacting performance, I worked with the backend team to refine endpoints and reduce bandwidth.

The contract was completed successfully in 9 weeks.

 "I worked with Jeremy to create a non-linear, responsive content authoring tool for Starling Minds. Jeremy did great work. He worked incredibly hard. He got the job done under a lot of pressure, and he was a pleasure to work with. He always made time for feedback and implemented requests in a smart and timely fashion. I look forward to our next opportunity to work together. Thanks Jeremy!"

The Wax Shop is a new waxing salon in Kelowna, BC. They needed someone to build and host their website, working with their design & marketing people. They also needed an internal web application that integrates with the Booker API.

This all had to be completed on a very short timeline. I built the site with Vue.js, Nuxt for SSR and NGINX for proxying and SSL termination.

Tangent Cafe is a restaurant on Commercial Drive in Vancouver offering Malaysian-fusion cuisine, a wide selection of craft beers and live music. They had an old website that was no longer serving their needs.

They were primarily looking for an attractive site that showcased their food menu, an automatically-updating list of their craft beers, and it had to work well on mobile phones.

I took design cues from their original website and menu and coded a custom integration with <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Untappd!</a> (a craft beer app) to create a constantly up-to-date craft beer menu.

The Bread Magazine, a restaurant industry magazine, came to me for help moving online. They wanted a publishing platform that captured the essence of their print magazine.

I helped them refine their design, then brought it to life. I built them a custom WordPress theme and I hosted it on a dedicated VM running Nginx and PHP-FPM.

 <blockquote>
  ...We walked into our website building experience with naive expectations and vague ideas. Jeremy worked with us from the beginning and provided guidance in bouts of uncertainty. This was our first time doing anything like this but Jeremy was patient and prompt with our revisions. Now we have a beautiful and functional website that is in-line with our vision. We will certainly work with him again."
