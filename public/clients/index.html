<p>Running a business is hard work. My job is to make your life easier.</p>

<p>My combination of business and technical training allow me to deliver unbeatable value.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>I employ a 4-step process that minimizes disruption to your operations:</p>

<h3 id="establish-needs"><strong>Establish needs</strong></h3>

<p>This is when I get to know your business and figure out what your website needs to accomplish, as well as the look and feel.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are you a pub that wants to showcase their current beers on tap?</p></li>

<li><p>Are you a restaurant that needs a mobile-friendly menu?</p></li>

<li><p>Would you like clients to be able to schedule appointments?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="development"><strong>Development</strong></h3>

<p>This is a collaborative process, during which I seek your input and make changes as necessary. I spare you any technical details that you aren&rsquo;t interested in, so you can focus on running your business.</p>

<h3 id="deployment-and-hosting"><strong>Deployment and Hosting</strong></h3>

<p>This is the part where I deliver a secure, fast, attractive website. I host your website on a server that I fully control. No flaky shared hosting providers here!</p>

<h3 id="ongoing-assistance"><strong>Ongoing assistance</strong></h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be there for your business in the future. Updates, overhauls, small tweaks, you name it.</p>

<h2 id="testimonials">Testimonials</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t just take my word for it. Here is what some of the folks I have worked with had to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I had know it would be this easy, I would have replaced our old website a long time ago.</p>

<p>&mdash; Nate, Owner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tangent Cafe is a restaurant on Commercial Drive offering Malaysian-fusion cuisine, a wide selection of craft beers and live music. They had an old website that was no longer serving their needs.</p>

<p>They were primarily looking for an attractive site that showcased their food menu, an automatically-updating list of their craft beers, and it had to work well on mobile phones.</p>

<p>I took design cues from their original website and menu and coded a custom integration with Untappd! (a craft beer app) to create a constantly up-to-date craft beer menu.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working with Jeremy Poole was a delight. We are a media start-up with a very small staff. We walked into our website building experience with naive expectations and vague ideas. Jeremy worked with us from the beginning and provided guidance in bouts of uncertainty. This was our first time doing anything like this but Jeremy was patient and prompt with our revisions. Now we have a beautiful and functional website that is in-line with our vision. We will certainly work with him again.</p>
