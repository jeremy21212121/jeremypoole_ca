# JeremyPoole.ca Hugo Repo

This repo contains the content and theme for my professional website, [JeremyPoole.ca](https://jeremypoole.ca). It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator.

The theme is a modified version of [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

At some point I will seperate out the theme into its own repo.

## dev / build

dev:
```hugo serve --noHTTPCache```

build:
```hugo -d export/ -b "https://jeremypoole.ca"```
