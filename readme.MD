# JeremyPoole.ca Hugo Repo

This repo contains the content and theme for my personal/professional website, JeremyPoole.ca. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator.

The theme is a modified version of [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

At some point I will seperate out the theme into its own repo.
